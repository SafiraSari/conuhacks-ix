# [NAME OF PROJECT]
NEEDS A HOOK. [NAME OF PROJECT] is a sort of social media platform where gamers can unite to discuss and share their favourite video game titles. With an easy to use interface, users can track their game progress, curate custom lists, and talk with peers.

## Application Features
#### Game Progression Tracking
> Users can track the games that they've played as well as the hours they've spent on them. Their statistics will be pulled to show important data, such as top games played, total playtime, etc., for efficient flexing between friends.
#### Custom List Curation
> Make custom lists to more easily share games with your friends. Want to create a list of games with incredible soundtracks? Of games with funky weapons? Of games where you can raise a pet? Simply assemble a list with the games added and give it a title.
#### Peer Forums
> Discuss your favourite strategies, overpowered builds, crazy challenges, and more with our peer forums. Open the game's profile page; scroll to the forums section; discuss with fellow gamers; profit.

## Scalability and Future Implementation
- The implementation of annual statistics report allows for a fun and interesting lookback on a player's year.
- Search functions benefit from deeper categorisation of games.
